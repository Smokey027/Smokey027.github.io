            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> Welcome and thank you for taking the time to visit my ePortfolio site. This ePortfolio has been created to showcase the knowledge and skills that I have gained during my time in the Bachelor's program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). This portfolio and the project included within it represent an evolution of my skills from their original to enhanced versions. I designed this ePortfolio as a professionally written, visually appealing, and informative gateway into the progression of my educational and professional self. I have combined a visually demonstrative, coherent, and technically sound project to appeal to educators, collaborators, and employers alike.</p>

            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> Code review is an essential part of the development process. This step in the process can provide improved code quality, allow for collaboration between peers, and allow for free thinking amongst an organization. Code review helps to ensure quality projects and is a main component in the debug process. Having a refinement plan during this time will allow the review to be efficient, achievable, and provide updated code. Best practices for code reviews should enclude setting clear goals, correct code practices, radability, maintainability, and security. As part of a proper software development life cycle, code review and refinement allow for the most collaborative and well-built project possible. Follow the refinement plan and code review link for a break down of my code review and enhancement plan. For more insights into my original code base and its strengths and weaknesses watch my code review using the following link. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eo0bEmdYWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Event Tracking App code review</a>.</p>

            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> As showcased in the <a href="refinement-plan-and-code-review.html" title="Refinement Plan and Code Review">Refinement Plan and Code Review</a>, the artifact that I selected for the Software Design and Engineering category is the <strong>Mobile Event Tracking Application</strong>. The applications goal is to track and manage users life events using Android mobile devices. The software was planned, designed, and developed as part of the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Design computer science course at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) in 2023. The application was developed  using JAVA programming language with integration to the relational database SQLite. The development and programming tool used is Android Studio IDE. The testing and running of the application on multiple Android devices, mainly Pixel 2, are ran through a device emulator inside Android Studio. In this category I made enhancements in UI/UX design, improved security and error handling, and implemented user-centered design techniques. The software design and engineering plan, along with skills used and outcomes achieved can be found on the Software Design and Engineering page which is linked above.</p>

The program was planned, designed, and developed as part of the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Design computer science course at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) in 2023. The program is produced in the JAVA programming language as I did with the software design and engineering category of this project. I once again used the Android Studio IDE for development in this area and used an emulator inside Android Studio to test and design the algorithms and data structures. In this category I made enhancments to the data structures and algorithms of the application. I optimized the strucutres and improved performance with more efficient algorithms. I also implemented multilingual support in this category. The algorithms and data structures plan, enhancments, and course outcomes it fulfilled can be found on the Algorithms and Data Structure page which is linked above. .</p>

The program was once again planned, designed, and developed as part of the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Design course at Southern New Hampshire Univerrsity (SNHU) in 2023. This program continues using JAVA programming language and the Android Studio IDE. The database within this project uses SQLite for data storage and management. I employed the emulator within Android Studio to design and test the functions of the database. I implemented encryption, authentication methodss, error handling and testing, and a normalized database schema to achieve the skills and outcomes of this project. The database ehancement skills and course outcomes can be found at the Databases link above.</p>
