            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome and thank you for taking the time to visit my ePortfolio site. This ePortfolio has been created to showcase the knowledge and skills that I have gained during my time in the Bachelor's program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). This portfolio and the project included within it represent an evolution of my skills from their original to enhanced versions. I designed this ePortfolio as a professionally written, visually appealing, and informative gateway into the progression of my educational and professional self. I have combined a visually demonstrative, coherent, and technically sound project to appeal to educators, collaborators, and employers alike.</p>

            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>I started in the Computer Science program in January of 2018, studying for as long as five years. I plan to join the program to improve my background in the programming and development of applications and web services. This effort was because of my passion for working with computers and technology, performing web development, and have led some IT projects and implementing IT infrastructures during my years of practicing Architecture.</p>
            <p>While in the Computer Science Program, I have learned and improved an innumerable number of abilities, skills, and knowledge. I have improved my attention to detail and security mindset as crucial skills to perform as a software engineer and developer. Being organized and cautious in my code development and doing it in simple blocks and testing as part of my workflow helps me improve these skills and abilities. Testing is crucial to ensuring a program works and is free of weaknesses and vulnerabilities and becomes more complicated as a project grows in complexity. Acknowledging and adopting a tester mindset and a security mindset are well-required skills and abilities that improve continuously.</p>

            <p>Each of the courses throughout the Computer Science program has impacted and helped to acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to position me in a job in the disciplines attached to Computer Science. While my learning was not limited to these classes, I felt that these were of more impact to me and expanded my roots into my initial plan of entering the Computer Science Program. From these courses, I learned and improved things I was not aware of being knowledgeable about or having the ability to grow in them. Because of that, I incorporate artifacts where the skills and skills learned in these courses, are demonstrated, showcased, and illustrated.</p>

            <h2>Preparing For The Future</h2>
            <p>The Computer Science program has helped me grow as a professional, preparing me to build a fulfilling and productive career and make a solid contribution to a computer science practice. Like a mountain climber approaching the summit, it is time to draw on my sense of motivation and refocus my energies. I have developed an ePortfolio that helps me take my place among computer science professionals; this is a significant achievement I am proud of.</p>

            <img class="img-center" src="EventTrackingApp/codereview.jpg" alt="Code Review Image" title="Code Review">
            <p>Code review is an essential part of the development process. This step in the process can provide improved code quality, allow for collaboration between peers, and allow for free thinking amongst an organization. Code review helps to ensure quality projects and is a main component in the debug process. Having a refinement plan during this time will allow the review to be efficient, achievable, and provide updated code. Best practices for code reviews should enclude setting clear goals, correct code practices, radability, maintainability, and security. As part of a proper software development life cycle, code review and refinement allow for the most collaborative and well-built project possible. Follow the refinement plan and code review link for a break down of my code review and enhancement plan.

            <p>As showcased in the <a href="refinement-plan-and-code-review.html" title="Refinement Plan and Code Review">Refinement Plan and Code Review</a>, the artifact that I selected for the Software Design and Engineering category is the <strong>Mobile Event Tracking Application</strong>. The applications goal is to track and manage users life events using Android mobile devices. The software was planned, designed, and developed as part of the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Design computer science course at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) in 2023. The application was developed  using JAVA programming language with integration to the relational database SQLite. The development and programming tool used is Android Studio IDE. The testing and running of the application on multiple Android devices, mainly Pixel 2, are ran through a device emulator inside Android Studio. In this category I made enhancements in UI/UX design, improved security and error handling, and implemented user-centered design techniques. The software design and engineering plan, along with skills used and outcomes achieved can be found on the Software Design and Engineering page which is linked above.</p>

            <p>As presented in the <a href="refinement-plan-and-code-review.html" title="Refinement Plan and Code Review">Refinement Plan and Code Review</a>, the artifact selected for the algorithms and data structure category is the <strong>Mobile Event Tracking Application</strong>. . The program was planned, designed, and developed as part of the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Design computer science course at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) in 2023. The program is produced in the JAVA programming language as I did with the software design and engineering category of this project. I once again used the Android Studio IDE for development in this area and used an emulator inside Android Studio to test and design the algorithms and data structures. In this category I made enhancments to the data structures and algorithms of the application. I optimized the strucutres and improved performance with more efficient algorithms. I also implemented multilingual support in this category. The algorithms and data structures plan, enhancments, and course outcomes it fulfilled can be found on the Algorithms and Data Structure page which is linked above. .</p>
