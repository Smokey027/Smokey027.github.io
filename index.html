            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>This ePortfolio integrates the knowledge and skills I gained and developed throughout the years of studying a Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). It represents my growth in the program and gained honor rolls from high-quality outcomes. The ePortfolio was designed and developed with a professional-quality written and a visual communication demonstrative of my capacities and abilities in a coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to a specific technical audience and context.</p>

            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>I started in the Computer Science program in January of 2018, studying for as long as five years. I plan to join the program to improve my background in the programming and development of applications and web services. This effort was because of my passion for working with computers and technology, performing web development, and have led some IT projects and implementing IT infrastructures during my years of practicing Architecture.</p>

            <p><em>Figure 1 - OpenGL ZigZag Chair - CS330 Computational Graphics and Visualization</em></p>
            <p>While in the Computer Science Program, I have learned and improved an innumerable number of abilities, skills, and knowledge. I have improved my attention to detail and security mindset as crucial skills to perform as a software engineer and developer. Being organized and cautious in my code development and doing it in simple blocks and testing as part of my workflow helps me improve these skills and abilities. Testing is crucial to ensuring a program works and is free of weaknesses and vulnerabilities and becomes more complicated as a project grows in complexity. Acknowledging and adopting a tester mindset and a security mindset are well-required skills and abilities that improve continuously.</p>

            <p>Each of the courses throughout the Computer Science program has impacted and helped to acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to position me in a job in the disciplines attached to Computer Science. While my learning was not limited to these classes, I felt that these were of more impact to me and expanded my roots into my initial plan of entering the Computer Science Program. From these courses, I learned and improved things I was not aware of being knowledgeable about or having the ability to grow in them. Because of that, I incorporate artifacts where the skills and skills learned in these courses, are demonstrated, showcased, and illustrated.</p>

            <h2>Preparing For The Future</h2>
            <p>The Computer Science program has helped me grow as a professional, preparing me to build a fulfilling and productive career and make a solid contribution to a computer science practice. Like a mountain climber approaching the summit, it is time to draw on my sense of motivation and refocus my energies. I have developed an ePortfolio that helps me take my place among computer science professionals; this is a significant achievement I am proud of.</p>

            <h2>Refinement Plan and Code Review</h2>
            <p>As a software engineer, I know that code reviews are critical aspects of software development. Code reviews ensure quality assurance for our project's code and often identify critical bugs early on in its life cycle. However, the typical code review can be tedious with too many meetings and meetings that waste time. We can think that code reviews add an unnecessary bureaucracy to our development life cycle or believe we are too small to warrant the effort. In both instances, we are mistaken.</p>

            <p>As showcased in the <a href="CodeReview" title="Refinement Plan and Code Review">artifact code review</a>, the artifact selected for the software design and engineering category is the <strong>mobile application Inventory App</strong>. The app's goal is to track an inventory of items using android mobile devices. The software was planned, designed, and developed as part of the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming computer science course. The application is developed in JAVA programming language with integration to the relational database SQLite. The development and programming tool used is Android Studio IDE. The testing and running of the app are through a Nexus device emulator inside Android Studio.</p>

            <p>As presented in the <a href="CodeReview" title="Refinement Plan and Code Review">artifact code review</a>, the artifact selected for the algorithms and data structure category is the <strong>Zoo Monitoring System Program</strong>. The program aims to develop an authentication system that manages authentication and authorization for zookeeper users and administrators. The program was planned, designed, and developed as part of the IT145 Foundation in Application Development computer science course. The program is produced in the JAVA programming language as a standalone application running in the computer terminal. The initial development and programming tool used was Apache NetBeans IDE; however, I worked on the enhancements using a text editor. The testing and running of the app are through the computer terminal.</p>

            <p>As described in the <a href="CodeReview" title="Refinement Plan and Code Review">artifact code review</a>, the artifact selected for the databases category is the <strong>Salvare Search for Rescue Web App</strong>. The web application aims to develop a web interface that works with an existing database from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs to train for different rescues. The web app was planned, designed, and developed for the CS340 Client/Server Development computer science course. The application is developed in Python with the Dash framework and the non-relational database MongoDB. The integration of Python and MongoDB is through the python driver PyMongo. The application can run in Jupyter Notebook as a test tool and the computer terminal with an internet browser. The application's functionality involves a CSV data file of existing dogs in shelters to import into MongoDB, the import of dependencies such as Python PyMongo driver, Python libraries, Dash framework, and a Python source code and CRUD module to manipulate the data imported into MongoDB.</p>

                <em>"Being able to present your work in a cohesive manner is a skill that you will continue to refine in your career. The Zoo Monitoring with security and efficiency enhancements and interface as well as your extensive narratives is great work. This is a sound demonstration of making code more concise and therefore with this change a bit faster. Wonderful explanation of what you did with the application to integrate Python with the Dash framework. Code is clean and well commented! You made it. Congratulations and you should be proud. The hard skills and soft skills table is great. Very well done portfolio with clear content of your depth of understanding!"</em>
