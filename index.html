            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> Welcome and thank you for taking the time to visit my ePortfolio site. This ePortfolio has been created to showcase the knowledge and skills that I have gained during my time in the Bachelor's program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). This portfolio and the project included within it represent an evolution of my skills from their original to enhanced versions. The original code base and enhanced codes are located within my GitHub repository under EventTrackingApp, which is linked above. My repository also contains other projects I have created and showcases other skills in computer science. I have created a cohesive application using the same artifact for all three enhancement categories. I designed this ePortfolio as a professionally written, visually appealing, and informative gateway into the progression of my educational and professional self. I have combined a visually demonstrative, coherent, and technically sound project to appeal to educators, collaborators, and employers alike.</p>

        <section id="self-assessment">
            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> As I reflect on my journey through the Computer Science program and the development of my ePortfolio, I am proud of the skills and knowledge I have acquired, which have prepared me to excel in the field of computer science. The capstone project and various coursework assignments have not only strengthened my technical abilities but have also helped me shape my professional goals and values, setting me apart as a competitive candidate in the job market.</p>
            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> Throughout the program, I have had numerous opportunities to collaborate in team environments, which has been instrumental in honing my ability to work effectively with others. For instance, with the knowledge I have learned over my degree I have had the opportunity to work on a CRM system in my professional life. I participated in research and development to evolve a system for a roofing contractor. This experience taught me the importance of clear communication, task delegation, and conflict resolution, all of which are crucial skills in any professional setting. Additionally, working with others has helped me value diverse perspectives and fostered a collaborative spirit that I will carry into my future roles.</p>
            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> Communication with stakeholders is another critical skill I have developed during my studies. In the Software Development Life Cycle class, I worked on a project which saw me work as a SCRUM Master and provide a clear path for project completion. This experience taught me how to convey complex technical concepts in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that stakeholders understand the value and implications of our work. Effective communication is essential for bridging the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders, and I am confident in my ability to facilitate this dialogue.</p>
            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> My coursework has also provided me with a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms, which are the backbone of efficient software development. Through assignments and projects, I have gained hands-on experience in implementing various algorithms and data structures, such as binary trees, hash tables, and sorting algorithms. These skills are crucial for developing high-performance applications and solving complex computational problems.</p>
            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> In the realm of software engineering and databases, I have learned to design and implement robust, scalable systems. The capstone project, in particular, allowed me to integrate my knowledge of software development lifecycle methodologies, version control systems, and database design principles. I developed a comprehensive application that demonstrated my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, ensuring software quality and reliability.</p>
            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> Security is a paramount concern in today's digital landscape, and my program has equipped me with the necessary skills to address these challenges. Courses in cybersecurity have taught me about encryption techniques, secure coding practices, and vulnerability assessments. I have applied these concepts in projects that required implementing security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.</p>
            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> My ePortfolio is a culmination of these experiences and skills, showcasing the range of my computer science talents and abilities. The artifacts included in the portfolio demonstrate my proficiency in various areas, from software development and database management to algorithmic problem-solving and cybersecurity. Each artifact serves as a testament to my dedication to excellence and my readiness to contribute meaningfully to any organization.</p>
            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> In summary, my journey through the Computer Science program has been transformative, equipping me with the technical expertise and soft skills necessary to thrive in the field. My professional self-assessment highlights my strengths and accomplishments, and the ePortfolio serves as a comprehensive introduction to my capabilities. I am excited to leverage these skills as I enter the workforce and pursue a fulfilling career in computer science.</p>

            <p style ="text-indent: 40px;"> Code review is an essential part of the development process. This step in the process can provide improved code quality, allow for collaboration between peers, and allow for free thinking amongst an organization. Code review helps to ensure quality projects and is a main component in the debug process. Having a refinement plan during this time will allow the review to be efficient, achievable, and provide updated code. Best practices for code reviews should enclude setting clear goals, correct code practices, radability, maintainability, and security. As part of a proper software development life cycle, code review and refinement allow for the most collaborative and well-built project possible. Below I have provided a brief overview of the enhancement categories for the application. Follow the refinement plan and code review link for a break down of my code review and enhancement plan.

The applications goal is to track and manage users life events using Android mobile devices. The software was planned, designed, and developed as part of the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Design computer science course at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) in 2023. The application was developed  using JAVA programming language with integration to the relational database SQLite. The development and programming tool used is Android Studio IDE. The testing and running of the application on multiple Android devices, mainly Pixel 2, are ran through a device emulator inside Android Studio. In this category I made enhancements in UI/UX design, improved security and error handling, and implemented user-centered design techniques. The software design and engineering plan, along with skills used and outcomes achieved can be found on the Software Design and Engineering page which is linked above.</p>

The program is produced in the JAVA programming language as I did with the software design and engineering category of this project. I once again used the Android Studio IDE for development in this area and used an emulator inside Android Studio to test and design the algorithms and data structures. In this category I made enhancments to the data structures and algorithms of the application. I optimized the strucutres and improved performance with more efficient algorithms. I also implemented multilingual support in this category. The algorithms and data structures plan, enhancments, and course outcomes it fulfilled can be found on the Algorithms and Data Structure page which is linked above. .</p>
